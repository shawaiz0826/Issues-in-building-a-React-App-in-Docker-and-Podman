# Issues-in-building-a-React-App-in-Docker-and-Podman

Introduction
Docker and Podman are popular containerization tools that are widely used to build and deploy applications. When it comes to building a React app in a containerized environment, there are some issues that developers may encounter. In this blog, we will discuss some of the common issues in building a React app in Docker and Podman, and how to resolve them.

Issues and Resolutions
Node.js version : One of the most common issues developers face when building a React app in a container is related to the Node.js version. If the Node.js version in the container is different from the one used to develop the app, it can cause compatibility issues and lead to unexpected behavior.
To avoid this issue, make sure to specify the exact Node.js version in the Dockerfile or Podmanfile. You can use a base image that includes the required version of Node.js, or install it manually in the Dockerfile or Podmanfile.

For example, to install Node.js version 14.x in the Dockerfile, use the following command:

FROM node:14

Cache busting : Another issue that developers may face when building a React app in a container is related to caching. If the container is using an old cache, it can cause the app to behave unexpectedly or show outdated content.

To avoid this issue, you can use cache busting techniques in the Dockerfile or Podmanfile. For example, you can add a timestamp to the COPY command in the Dockerfile to force the container to rebuild the app when the source code changes:

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . ./?t=$(date +%s)
RUN npm run build

This will add a timestamp to the end of the COPY command, forcing the container to rebuild the app when the source code changes.
Port mapping : Another issue that developers may face when building a React app in a container is related to port mapping. If the container’s port is not mapped correctly to the host machine, it can prevent the app from being accessible from a web browser.

To avoid this issue, make sure to map the container’s port to the host machine’s port in the Dockerfile or Podmanfile. You can use the EXPOSE and -p flags in the Dockerfile or Podmanfile to map the port:

FROM node:14
EXPOSE 3000
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]

To run the container and map the port, use the following command:

docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app

Conclusion
Building a React app in a containerized environment can be challenging, but by understanding and addressing the common issues, you can ensure that your app runs smoothly in Docker or Podman. By specifying the correct Node.js version, using cache busting techniques, and mapping the container’s port to the host machine’s port, you can avoid common issues and ensure that your React app runs as expected.
